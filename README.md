**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**
> Graceful degradation and service workers are related concepts in web development aimed at maintaining a smooth user experience despite network or browser issues. Graceful degradation ensures that essential functionality is preserved even if some features fail. Service workers run in the background, intercept network requests, and provide offline functionality, thereby enhancing graceful degradation. They manage network resilience, cache resources, and implement fallback mechanisms, ensuring the application remains functional and performant under adverse conditions. Together, they ensure a consistent and reliable user experience.
